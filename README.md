# Instagram Non-Followers Tracker

This tool assists Instagram users in managing their follower relationships by identifying "non-followers," or users whom
they follow but who do not follow them back. Users can review these non-followers and either add them to a whitelist (if
they wish to continue following them regardless) or flag them for potential unfollowing.

This tool operates without requiring your login credentials and complies with Instagram's terms of service.
